# xeetBrain

xeetBrain transfers all your [X](https://x.com/) xeets into the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) graph view.

Why?
---

The reasoning is that the X / Twitter / Mastadon platform enables [depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) + [breadth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) thinking. Users can continuosly write down their thoughts in a linear breath wise fashion, but can also expand upon a thought in a depth wise fashion.

Essentially I found it to be a nice thinking tool to organize my thoughts. Over the years I have found myself absorbing information, but not really thinking about what my own opinion on the matter is.

How it works ( so far )
---

Users of xeetBrain must download their [X archive](https://x.com/settings/download_your_data), e.g. a collection of all their xeets.

You then place your data into xeetBrain and it outputs an Obsidian vault with all of your xeets, linked together in a linear fashion.

```
Your X data -> xeetBrain -> Obsidian vault
```

Notes
---

As of writing this, I only plan on making it work with X, until I transfer my thoughts to a local [Mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon) node. Mastodon is basically an open-source X / Twitter.
